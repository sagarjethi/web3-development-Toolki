### Audit Readiness Checklist

- [ ] **Use the latest major version of Solidity**: Update the Solidity version in the project to ensure compatibility and take advantage of the latest security features. For example, use Solidity version 0.8.4.

- [ ] **Leverage established libraries**: Utilize well-known and trusted libraries such as OpenZeppelin contracts. For instance, import `ERC20` from OpenZeppelin to handle token functionality.

- [ ] **Compile contracts without errors or warnings**: Ensure that the contracts compile without any issues. Run the compiler and fix any errors or warnings that arise.

- [ ] **Document all functions**: Add comments and documentation using NatSpec format to describe the purpose, inputs, and outputs of each function. For example, include detailed explanations for the `transfer` function in your token contract.

- [ ] **Make functions external when possible**: Identify public functions that do not require internal state access and mark them as `external` to save gas costs. For instance, modify the `getBalance` function to be `external`.

- [ ] **Thoroughly test "happy path" user scenarios**: Create test cases that cover all the intended functionality and expected outcomes. For example, test token transfers, contract deployments, and user interactions.

- [ ] **Follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern**: Structure the contract functions to first perform checks, then update state, and finally interact with external contracts. Use the pattern to prevent reentrancy and other security issues.

- [ ] **Minimize the use of assembly**: Reduce the usage of assembly code as much as possible, as it requires extra caution during auditing. Avoid assembly unless absolutely necessary.

- [ ] **Document the usage of unchecked operations**: Clearly explain why and when it is safe to use `unchecked` operations, such as arithmetic checks, without compromising security. Provide specific details for each operation in the code.

- [ ] **Run a spellchecker**: Use a spellchecking tool to identify and correct any spelling errors in your code and comments. Ensure that the codebase is free from typos.

- [ ] **Conduct static analysis**: Run a static analysis tool such as Slither or MythX on the codebase to catch potential vulnerabilities and receive helpful suggestions for improvement.

- [ ] **Seek an external review**: Engage an experienced Solidity developer or security expert from outside your organization to conduct an independent review of your contracts. Obtain feedback and address any major issues before proceeding with an official audit.

### Additional Recommendations

- [ ] **Implement fuzz tests**: Consider using fuzz testing tools like Foundry or hardhat-fuzz to further enhance bug detection by generating random inputs for your contract functions.

- [ ] **Write negative tests**: Create test cases to verify that certain actions should fail, such as attempting to withdraw funds prematurely. Ensure that the contract behaves correctly in these scenarios.

- [ ] **Explore formal verification tools**: Investigate the possibility of using formal verification tools to mathematically prove the correctness of critical parts of your contracts, although be aware that they may not be practical for complex systems.

- [ ] **Document security assumptions**: Clearly outline the assumptions you are making about the security of external components, third-party libraries, or platform guarantees. This helps auditors understand your perspective and identify potential risks.

- [ ] **Compile a focused list of areas for auditors**: Prepare a list of specific code sections, complex logic, or critical functions that you would like auditors to pay extra attention to during the audit. This helps them focus their efforts and provide valuable insights.
